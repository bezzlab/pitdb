# PIT-DB 

## A Resource for Sharing, Annotating and Analysing Translated Genomic Elements

The aim of this project is to develop a publicly available database, called PIT-DB, for the storage and sharing of results from PIT experiments. This database will provide an immediate benefit in allowing researchers to share and reanalyse the results of PIT experiments, and by pooling the results of these experiments will generate a large catalogue of TGE observations backed up by extensive experimental evidence. It will also act as a working prototype to demonstrate how the data from integrated RNA-seq and proteomic MS experiments could be incorporated into existing bioinformatics databases in the future.
